This is a project with the goal of learning the use of authentication systems, CRUD operations with databases, planning and execution of database structures, application frameworks, and learning how to make nicer README files.

## Getting Started
As a frequent user of Keep notes from Google, I thought creating something similar would be a great learning experience, with the hope to add features, I wish Keep notes would have.
